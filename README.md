# pytorch-quantization-aware-training-sample

### :fire: pytorch quantization easy sample 

:white_check_mark: support static post training quantization (***PTQ***)

:white_check_mark: support quantization aware training (***QAT***)

:white_check_mark: support initialize quant model with pre-trained model

:white_check_mark: support train quant model with QAT from scratch

:white_check_mark: support quantize only ***part of model***
